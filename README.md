HTML & CSS/Flexbox

This was another freeCodeCamp.org project. It was my first time building a form. It was also my first time working with various input types including radio buttons, dropdown selectors, checkboxes, and text areas. It wasn't required for the assignment, but I also took on the challenge of figuring out how to create a fixed background image just to see if I could do it.
